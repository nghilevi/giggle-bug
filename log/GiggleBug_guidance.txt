1) create html5 page, where you can overlay several png images on top of each other. take like the first frame of each folder/part (e.g. head, body, smile, etc) and overlay them, so you get the character to view

2) next, create a function, that can say, which number of picture on each component we'll use. e.g. i can call the function with 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5, 7 --> this will take the 1st image from GB_L1_antenna_L, 1st image from GB_L1_antenna_R, 4th image from GB_L1_arm_L, and so on. now we can manually change the values of the animation then
			

3) allow to create arrays of these values, which are pushed to animator function, which calls the function in 2 to animate the thing.
	so something like:
	animation={[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5, 7], [2, 2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5, 1], [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5, 7]}
	animate(animation)

	and that would play those frames
